I am a professionally trained scientist who has become extremely adept at identifying and then solving low hanging-fruit problems. 

I thrive in autonomously solving unstructured problems because my [Ph.D. scholarship with Erik Sahai](http://crick.ac.uk) granted me rigorous scientific discipline with a particular penchant for video acquisition & analysis using ML/AI.  

I've made ML/AI tools at amazing pharmaceutical companies such as [GSK](http://gsk.ai) & [Regeneron](http://www.regeneron.com) to derive meaning from healthcare imaging data.

More than writing ML/AI code for healthcare, I've produced ML/AI pipelines at video analytics technology companies like [Actuate](http://actuate.ai) to deploy production level, serverless, real-time gun/intruder, and novel slip/fall detection AI algorithms to a network of 20K+ cameras.  

> My general interests are at the intersection of computer vision, explainable AI, model quantization, and model deployment. In short, I want to bring **useful** real-time vision AI to the masses.
